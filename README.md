# Artsy Motivation

I really enjoy discovering free API's and seeing what I can do with them. A website I used a lot while teaching was the inspiration for this little personal project. https://www.onceuponapicture.co.uk/

A simple application using React Router to display artwork from the Public API of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. I created a simple UX Design with hover effects and reusable button components.

### Technologies used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ReactRouter, ReactHooks (useState, useEffect), reuseable components

### API's

The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API
https://metmuseum.github.io/
